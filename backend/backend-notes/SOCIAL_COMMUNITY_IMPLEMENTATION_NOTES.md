**Project:** Anointed Backend  


## Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation of social and community features for the Anointed platform, including database models, migrations, and comprehensive test coverage.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Social Models (Groups & Membership)

#### Group Model
- **Purpose**: Community organization and management

- **Fields**:
  - `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
  - `postId` (UUID, Foreign Key → Post)
  - `userId` (UUID, Foreign Key → User)
  - `type` (ENUM: LIKE/AMEN/PRAYER)
  - `createdAt` (Timestamp)
- **Constraints**: Unique constraint `(postId, userId, type)`

## Database Schema Changes

### Enums Added
```sql
-- Group privacy levels
CREATE TYPE "GroupPrivacy" AS ENUM ('PUBLIC', 'PRIVATE');

-- Group member roles
CREATE TYPE "GroupMemberRole" AS ENUM ('ADMIN', 'MODERATOR', 'MEMBER');

-- Post types for content categorization
CREATE TYPE "PostType" AS ENUM ('POST', 'TESTIMONY');

-- Post moderation status
CREATE TYPE "PostStatus" AS ENUM ('ACTIVE', 'REMOVED', 'PENDING_MOD');

-- Reaction types for spiritual engagement
CREATE TYPE "ReactionType" AS ENUM ('LIKE', 'AMEN', 'PRAYER');
```

### Tables Created
1. **groups** - Community organization
2. **group_members** - Membership management with composite PK
3. **posts** - Content creation with JSONB media support
4. **comments** - Post engagement
5. **reactions** - Spiritual engagement tracking

### Relationships Established
- User → Groups (creator relationship)
- User → Group Memberships (many-to-many through group_members)
- User → Posts, Comments, Reactions (authorship)
- Group → Posts (community content)
- Post → Comments, Reactions (engagement)

## Migrations Applied

### Migration 1: `20250907165023_add_social_community_models`
- Created Group and GroupMember models
- Established user relationships
- Added privacy and role enums

### Migration 2: `20250907165307_add_content_models`
- Created Post, Comment, and Reaction models
- Added content type and status enums
- Implemented unique constraints for reactions
- Added JSONB support for media URLs

## Database Optimizations

### Indexes Created
- **Groups**: `created_by`, `privacy`, `created_at`
- **Group Members**: `user_id`, `role`
- **Posts**: `user_id`, `group_id`, `type`, `status`, `created_at`
- **Comments**: `post_id`, `user_id`, `created_at`
- **Reactions**: `post_id`, `user_id`, `type`

### Cascade Behaviors
- **ON DELETE CASCADE**: User deletion removes all related content
- **ON DELETE SET NULL**: Group deletion preserves posts but removes group association
- **Unique Constraints**: Prevent duplicate reactions per user per post per type

## Test Coverage Implemented

### Unit Tests

#### Social Models Test (`social-models.test.js`)
- **20 tests** covering Group and GroupMember functionality
- **Coverage**:
  - Group creation, validation, updates, soft delete
  - Membership management with role enforcement
  - Composite primary key constraints
  - Cascade delete behavior
  - Complex relationship queries

#### Content Models Test (`content-models.test.js`)
- **33 tests** covering Post, Comment, and Reaction functionality
- **Coverage**:
  - Post creation with JSONB media URLs
  - Enum validation for types and statuses
  - Comment threading and management
  - Reaction uniqueness constraints
  - Soft delete functionality
  - Engagement counter management

### Integration Tests

#### Social Content Flow Test (`social-content-flow.test.js`)
- **3 comprehensive integration tests**
- **End-to-End Workflow**:
  - User creation → Group formation → Membership management
  - Content creation → Community engagement → Moderation
  - Complex queries and concurrent operations
- **Test Data Created**:
  - 4 users with different roles
  - 2 groups (public prayer circle, private testimony sharing)
  - 3 group memberships with varied roles
  - 4 posts (prayer requests, testimonies, encouragement)
  - 4 comments across different posts
  - 10 reactions testing all reaction types

### Test Results
- ✅ **57 tests passed**
- ✅ **0 tests failed**
- ✅ **100% test suite success**
- ✅ **Comprehensive edge case coverage**

## Key Features Validated

### Business Logic
- **Group Privacy**: Public groups discoverable, private groups restricted
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin/Moderator/Member hierarchy
- **Content Moderation**: Active/Removed/Pending status workflow
- **Spiritual Engagement**: Like/Amen/Prayer reaction system
- **Media Support**: JSONB array storage for multiple media URLs

### Data Integrity
- **Unique Constraints**: Prevent duplicate memberships and reactions
- **Referential Integrity**: Proper foreign key relationships
- **Soft Deletes**: Preserve data history while hiding content
- **Concurrent Safety**: Proper handling of simultaneous operations

### Performance Considerations
- **Strategic Indexing**: Optimized for common query patterns
- **Counter Denormalization**: commentCount/reactionCount for performance
- **JSONB Storage**: Efficient media URL array handling
- **Cascade Optimization**: Minimal database round trips

## Files Created/Modified

### Schema Files
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Updated with all new models and relationships
- `prisma/migrations/20250907165023_add_social_community_models/migration.sql`
- `prisma/migrations/20250907165307_add_content_models/migration.sql`

### Test Files
- `src/tests/unit/social-models.test.js` - Group and membership tests
- `src/tests/unit/content-models.test.js` - Post, comment, reaction tests
- `src/tests/integration/social-content-flow.test.js` - End-to-end workflow tests

### Documentation
- `SOCIAL_COMMUNITY_IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` (this file)

## Technical Decisions Made

### Database Design
- **Composite Primary Keys**: Used for GroupMember to ensure natural relationship modeling
- **JSONB for Media**: Flexible storage for varying numbers of media attachments
- **Enum Types**: Strong typing for business logic constraints
- **Soft Deletes**: Preserve data integrity while allowing content removal

### Testing Strategy
- **Layered Testing**: Unit tests for individual models, integration tests for workflows
- **Data Isolation**: Each test suite manages its own test data
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Invalid enum values, constraint violations, concurrent operations
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Prayer groups, testimony sharing, community engagement

### Performance Optimizations
- **Strategic Indexing**: Based on expected query patterns
- **Counter Caching**: Avoid expensive COUNT queries in real-time
- **Relationship Preloading**: Minimize N+1 query problems
- **Cascade Behavior**: Optimized for data consistency and performance

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- **Nested Comments**: Threading support for deeper conversations
- **Reaction Analytics**: Engagement metrics and insights
- **Content Scheduling**: Planned post publishing
- **Media Processing**: Image/video optimization and thumbnails
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time engagement alerts
- **Search Functionality**: Full-text search across posts and comments

### Scaling Considerations
- **Pagination**: For large groups and post feeds
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Media CDN**: External storage for user-uploaded content
- **Database Partitioning**: Time-based partitioning for large datasets
